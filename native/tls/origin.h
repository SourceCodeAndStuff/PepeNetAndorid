/* origin.h — pure name→origin resolution logic (no store, no network, no TLS).

 * This is the testable heart of slice 4's resolver: turning an SNI name plus a
 * folded pepenet zone into the OriginInfo the proxy dials + DANE-verifies. It
 * deliberately holds NO I/O — the store/view plumbing lives in resolve.{h,c},
 * so this layer can be proven hermetically against a hand-built zone (see
 * origin_test.c). The byte-level TLSA extraction here is exactly what feeds
 * dane_connect, so it is security-critical and unit-pinned.
