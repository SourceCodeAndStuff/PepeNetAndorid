// dirscan.h — the Discover directory (meld §6): the enumerable .pepe website

// name — but a *website* is a name whose zone contains an A record, so the
// cheaper primary axis is the dns store's held zones (store_heads_iter), each
// folded and joined against the registry for its lease/owner.
//
// The join is far too slow per frame, so a background thread rebuilds a
// double-buffered snapshot on a timer / dirty kick; the UI takes a copy.
